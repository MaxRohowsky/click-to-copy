You can run the extension locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store.

2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the [main folder](https://github.com/maxontech/click-to-copy/tree/master/main) (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use the extension locally.

Creating a very simple Chrome extension involves a few basic steps. In this example, we'll create an extension that changes the background color of any webpage when you click on its icon. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
Google Chrome browser.
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Step 2: Create a New Folder for Your Extension

Create a new folder on your computer where you'll store your extension's files. You can name this folder anything you like; for this example, let's call it "simple-extension."

Step 3: Create Manifest File

The manifest file defines the metadata and permissions for your extension. Create a file named manifest.json inside your "simple-extension" folder and add the following content:

json
Copy code
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Simple Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Change webpage background color",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/icon16.png",
      "48": "images/icon48.png",
      "128": "images/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "images/icon16.png",
    "48": "images/icon48.png",
    "128": "images/icon128.png"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
